For this month's MaptimeATL instructional session, [Langdon Sanders](http://langdonsanders.com/) will be demonstrating his custom cartography skills by presenting us with various cartography tips that will help bring realism to our maps. 

A great map, whether it be static or web-enabled, has a story that it's trying to tell. These techniques will provide us with new and innovate ways to tell those stories! Bring your laptop, a can-do attitude, and your questions!

After the main presentation and discussion, there will be a time for show-and-tell. Please bring anything map-related that you've been working on or have learned about to show to the group!

There will be free pizza and sodas sponsored by CartoDB. Thanks to [The Iron Yard](https://www.theironyard.com/locations/atlanta.html) and [CartoDB](http://cartodb.com) for sponsoring us!

See you there!
