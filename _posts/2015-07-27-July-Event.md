For this month's MaptimeATL instructional session, [Roy Hewitt](https://twitter.com/R0Yhewitt) will lead us in learning the [basics of interactive web maps](slides.royhewitt.com/web-maps) and how to create them. Bring your laptop, a can-do attitude, and your questions!

After the main presentation and discussion, there will be a time for show-and-tell. Please bring anything map-related that you've been working on or have learned about to show to the group!

There will be free pizza and sodas sponsored by CartoDB. Thanks to The Iron Yard and CartoDB for sponsoring us!

See you there!
